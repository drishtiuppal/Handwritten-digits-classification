# Handwritten-digits-classification


This repository contains a handwritten digits classification project using a neural network model. The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set contains 60,000 samples, and the testing set contains 10,000 samples.

Normalization is performed to scale the pixel values between 0 and 1.

The images are flattened into 1D arrays by reshaping them to 784 elements.

A confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the testing set.
